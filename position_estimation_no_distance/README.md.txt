This example uses the metadata from the jpeg image produces by the Android app OpenCamera to get the location and orientation.
The user gives a dummy distance and then the script calculates the position of the location pointed by the center of the camera.
Basically the vector from the center of the camera with length D. Lat Long and altitude are returned.
